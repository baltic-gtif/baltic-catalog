This repository is modified through pull requests submitted by the EOxHub Workspaces [data editor](https://documentation.hub.eox.at/data-editor/) within the **[baltic workspace](https://workspace.baltic-gtif.hub-otc.eox.at/)**.

## Assets
Configuration files like Style, JSONForm, VegaChart definitions, and thumbnails are stored in the [assets repository](https://github.com/baltic-gtif/assets/) and can be modified independently of the EOxHub workspace data editor.
