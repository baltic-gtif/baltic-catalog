  "Description": "# Lithuanian Permanent Grassland and their habitats\nNatural PGs are ecosystems, where implementation of usual practices consciously adjusted to the actual conditions is able to create a high biodiversity value in a relatively short time-frame.\n\nThe way PGs are maintained by machinery and grazing are serious limiting factors of the ecosystem health. Timing of any activity to be adjusted to climate conditions (wet/dry periods) is essential not to destroy certain vulnerable fauna and herbaceous flora.\n\n\n#### Data Sources:\n* PG parcels are from open governmental IACS GSA data (2024), managed by the National Paying Agency of Lithuania (NMA)\n* Habitat is from open published dataset in LT, in relation to the INSPIRE Directive",
