  "Description": "# Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) - Lithuania\nDue to their extensive root systems and high microbial activity, **Natural Permanent Grasslands (PG)** act as important **organic carbon sinks**. The intensity and type of management, particularly mowing frequency and livestock grazing, critically influence grassland SOC levels.\nWhile intensive grazing can lead to reductions in soil carbon, rotational or adaptive grazing can stimulate plant growth and enhance carbon capture and storage in grassland soils.\n\n### Data Sources:\n- **Global Soil Organic Carbon content and Sequestration Potential Maps (GSOCseq) V1.0.0**: Estimation of topsoil (0-30 cm) soil organic carbon sequestration potential in agricultural areas under a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario and a Sustainable Soil Management (SSM3) scenarios.
