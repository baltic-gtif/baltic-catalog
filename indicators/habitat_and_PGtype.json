  "Description": "# Lithuanian Permanent Grasslands and Their Habitats\n\n**Natural Permanent Grasslands (PGs)** are ecosystems in which well-adapted, context-appropriate **management practices** can create and maintain high biodiversity value within a relatively short time.\n\nThe way PGs are managed, whether through mowing or livestock grazing, has a major impact on overall ecosystem health. The timing of these activities is critical: operations must be adjusted to current climate and soil conditions (e.g., wet or dry periods) to avoid damaging vulnerable fauna and herbaceous plant communities. \n\n## Data Sources\n\n- **PG parcels (2024)** from the open governmental IACS GSA data, managed by the National Paying Agency of Lithuania (NMA).\n\n- **Habitat** data from publicly available Lithuanian datasets published in accordance with the INSPIRE Directive.
